Correct, but allow me to explain why: Hydrophobic light-activated adhesive (HLAA) is a type of glue that sets in seconds, but only after exposure to ultraviolet light. One biocompatible, biodegradable HLAA is under consideration for use in human tissue repair as a replacement for sutures, staples and other approaches. And if disposed it will decompose to microorganisms and therefore it is biodegrable. Thank You!
